Learning Python + DSA before college | Building my dream 
# CJREX | Python • DSA • Projects | Building With Purpose 💻

Hi, I’m CJREX — a Computer Science student deeply committed to building a strong tech career through consistent learning, impactful projects, and real-world problem solving.

I come from a background where every step forward matters — and I'm here to make it count. This repo reflects my journey to master coding, build real-world skills, and grow into someone who makes both \*\*my family and future self \*\* proud.

This repository is my personal learning journey and proof of growth — from zero to confidence. Everything I learn, build, or practice will live here.
